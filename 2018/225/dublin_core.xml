      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en_US">This case study examines a small co-design team within a larger multi-year design-based implementation research (DBIR) project. During the 2015-2016 school year, a group of teachers and researchers collaboratively designed and piloted four English language arts (ELA) project-based learning (PBL) curricular units. Teachers and researchers split into four teams, one of which was tasked with designing a project that examined relationships between humans and technology. Throughout this team's design process, co-designers encountered moments of tension that led to increased productivity; however, these tensions also pointed to the ways that participants struggled to navigate multiple roles and goals in agentic ways. This study uses Wertsch's (1991) notion of mediated action to examine the ways that designed curricular objects mediate co-designers' multiple roles (Penuel et al., 2015) and connected goals. </dcvalue>
