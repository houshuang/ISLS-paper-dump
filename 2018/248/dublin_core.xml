      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en_US">At the advanced level of learning, the ability to use relational knowledge becomes essential. In this study, the changes in the use of scientific concepts in the university students’ explanations were examined in the context of direct current (DC) circuits. The students participated in three small group sessions with several predict-test-explain-tasks. The use of scientific concepts and their relations were analysed from session transcripts using content analysis and categories of explanatory power were formed. Then, the changes in explanatory power during DC-tasks were analysed and three categories of conceptual patterns were formed. In first category, no conceptual development occurred, students used simple explanations and were not able to apply relational knowledge. In second category, conceptual development occurred: students explanations became more scientific and their explanatory power increased. In third category, the students have learned to use relational knowledge and the conceptual pattern shows flexibility in providing explanations.</dcvalue>
