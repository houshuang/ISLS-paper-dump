      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en_US">A major goal in education is to provide students with opportunities to engage in “deep learning,” in which knowledge and skills transfer to novel contexts. This study took place in one 4th grade classroom and drew on design-based research methods to investigate how the design and enactment of scientific modeling tasks in a project-based science unit influenced 4th grade students’ sense-making regarding the concept of energy transfer and their epistemological understandings about models and the practice of scientific modeling. Data sources for this study included field notes, video, student artifacts, assessments, and student interviews. Students developed emergent understandings of the concept of energy transfer and the role of models to test, refine, and communicate ideas. This study has implications for the design and incorporation of scientific modeling tasks in curricula, as well as the field’s understanding of the development of upper elementary students’ sense-making regarding the concept of energy transfer.</dcvalue>
