      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en_US">The effectiveness of collaborative inquiry learning in simulation-based learning environments for STEM education has been well-documented. At the same time, research indicates that some students struggle with articulating relevant concepts, making their reasoning explicit and regulating their learning—skills that are necessary for effective collaboration. In this study, using qualitative and quantitative analysis as well as data mining techniques, we investigated what promotes meaningful interaction between students when conducting collaborative inquiry. One hundred and fifty-six students from five high schools and colleges in the United States worked in groups of three to solve electronics tasks with increasing complexity in a virtual environment called Teaching Teamwork. The results showed that when the groups successfully solved the tasks, they showed statistically significant higher proposition generation, regulation and sustaining mutual understanding; when they did not solve the tasks, they showed significantly higher orientation, interpretation and conclusion. Explanations for these results and research recommendations are provided.</dcvalue>
