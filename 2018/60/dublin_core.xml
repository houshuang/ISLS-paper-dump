      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en_US">The goal of the Bots for Tots project is to develop theory around the role of activity framing on diverse participation in making and construction practices. In Bots for Tots, a design-based research project in three locations over two years, builders create a "dream toy" for a younger member of their local community. We hypothesized that building for others would appeal to young girls that may not typically see building robots and racecars as aligning with their goals and values. Data indicates participating girls consistently considered their "client" throughout the design process and were interested in continuing to build for others after the project ended. We show how the degree to which the "other" impacts the construction process depends on the quality of the relationship between builder and client. We propose recentering "women's ways of knowing" in maker practices to broaden participation among women in STEM domains.</dcvalue>
