      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en_US">Teachers need to know what aspects of any proposed innovative practice are supported by evidence and are likely to be effective. However, when there is insufficient time or money to conduct a detailed trial of each proposed innovation, are there other less resource intensive methods that can be used? Here, we present a study conducted with thirty-six learning sciences experts and practitioners who were asked to judge the potential effectiveness of eighty collaborative learning activities using an adaptive comparative judgment (ACJ) approach. The results of the ACJ process show that the most innovative and effective collaborative learning activities are those that are monitored but not formally assessed. In addition, the use of technology and explicit support of students’ social and problem-solving skills are identified as important features of innovative collaborative learning activities that are likely to be effective. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it presents features of innovative collaborative learning practice that are considered to be important for effectiveness by experts. Second, it provides an ‘innovative’ research approach to assess educational practice when teaching is considered as a design science rather than a theoretical science. </dcvalue>
