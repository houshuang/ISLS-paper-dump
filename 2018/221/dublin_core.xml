      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en_US">Educative curricula are often considered as one potential vehicle to support changes in how students learn science in classrooms, especially for instruction currently not aligned with ambitious instructional reforms. Our work presents one such effort, focused on teachers as a community of learners. Using a design-based approach, we developed a web-based tool, iPlan, which provides online access to educative curriculum materials in an interactive learning platform. The purpose of this study is to examine design features of iPlan in terms of affordances and challenges. We examine an implementation in an integrated math-science curriculum unit. Through qualitative analysis of interviews with 13 high-school biology teachers across two cycles of design and testing, we identified the ways in which teachers used and learned from the iPlan tool; which features seem to work and why. The study provides implications for developing online learning environments for teachers. </dcvalue>
