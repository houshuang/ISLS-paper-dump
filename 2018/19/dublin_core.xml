      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en_US">The current study aims to explore predictors that independently contribute to high school teacher use of technology in general and for different teaching purposes (student-centered and traditional). High school teachers (N=928) responded to a survey that consisted of measures of their pedagogical beliefs, beliefs towards technology, and perceived training effectiveness. A series of multilevel models were used to explore the independent effects of these factors on teacher use of technology in general and for different teaching purposes. The results showed that teachers’ technology self-efficacy was a significant predictor of teacher use of technology in general. More importantly, teachers’ instructional approach and openness towards technology were more salient when predicting teacher use technology to support student-centered teaching. Our findings suggest that teachers’ pedagogical readiness is as important as technological readiness for technology integration in teaching to serve more advanced teaching purposes. </dcvalue>
