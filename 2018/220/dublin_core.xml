      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en_US">This paper reports on a professional learning (PL) program blending independent and collegial contexts. The program was supported by classroom video and technology to notice and respond to students' thinking. Two cohorts of teachers used software and paper-based supports to plan, capture and study video of their own classrooms, and to develop and share video cases. The research explored what teachers notice about their students' thinking during independent study and collegial study of classroom video. This paper highlights a case study of one teacher's PL. Video cases, transcripts of independent study, collegial study meetings and of an exit interview were analyzed. Doing the independent study first, the teacher identified problematic student thinking to discuss with colleagues. Collegial discussion subsequently clarified students' thinking and explored next steps in teaching. Affordances of independent and collegial learning contexts, and the role of video, technology, and related supports in fostering teachers' PL are discussed. </dcvalue>
