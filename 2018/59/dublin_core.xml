      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en_US">Abstract: Although efforts to critique deficit models of cognition and address educational inequity are foundational to the learning sciences, there has been particularly rich work done in this tradition in recent years. In this paper, I offer a set of pathways that characterize this work towards justice in the learning sciences, work which reflects a variety of means and ends. The pathways are: (1) Consider the goals of an equity-oriented framework for learning; (2) Theoretically, draw on existing critical social theory; (3) Methodologically, focus on collaborative change-making, and; (4) Support heterogeneity in knowing and doing. These pathways are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive, but rather provide an assessment of the current justice-oriented landscape in the learning sciences. I then argue that heterogeneity in means and ends towards addressing learning inequities is fruitful for the field and offer some open questions with which the critical learning sciences has yet to fully contend. </dcvalue>
