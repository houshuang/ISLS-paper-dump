      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en_US">Connected learning explains how people can build learning pathways that connect their interests, relationships with others, and formal learning to lead toward future opportunities. However, most learning systems are not set up ideally for connected learning. This paper analyzes two case studies of cosplayers-hobbyists who make their own costumes of media characters to wear at fan conventions-who benefited from a well-developed connected learning ecology. Cases were drawn from a larger interview study and further analyzed as compelling examples of connected learning. Important themes that emerged included sponsorship by family, friends, and adult mentors; unique pathways that start with a difficult challenge; and comparisons with formal school experiences. This has implications for how we can design connected learning ecologies that support all learners on unique pathways toward fulfilling futures.</dcvalue>
