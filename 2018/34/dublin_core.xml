      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en_US">This study explored the mediating role that teachers play in helping students utilize multiple models as tools for scientific thinking. We analyzed two teachers' discourse as they facilitated students' use of virtual and physical models and compared their students' understanding of and engagement with models during a biology unit. We found that one teacher had significantly more talk than the other about the affordances and constraints of models, and his students more purposefully used the affordances of the models to engage in scientific thinking on their own and seemed to learn more about affordances and constraints of scientific models than students in the other teacher’s class. Our findings suggest that the ways in which teachers talk about the affordances and constraints of scientific models is important for students to understand and utilize them as tools for thinking and building knowledge.</dcvalue>
