      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en_US">Abstract: This qualitative interpretive study used content and discourse analysis to examine pre-service teachers’ perceptions of past collaborative efforts, and how those perceptions influenced their collaboration in four-member groups during design and delivery of a collaborative instructional project. Participants (N=24) were in their first semester of under-graduate teacher preparation. Qualitative data from written-reflections, semi-structured interviews and recorded audio-video observations were collected and compared to an ordinal ranking of groups’ collaborative instruction. Content analysis indicated pre-service perceptions of past collaborative experiences could be characterized as either a flexible orientation toward collaboration or an inflexible orientation toward collaboration. Discourse analysis indicated that pre-service perceptions of past collaborative experiences impacted students’ current collaborative efforts and outcomes. Students with a flexible orientation collaborated with higher quality interactions than students with an inflexible orientation. In turn, groups with members having a flexible orientation created and delivered higher quality collaborative instruction than groups with only members having an inflexible orientation. </dcvalue>
