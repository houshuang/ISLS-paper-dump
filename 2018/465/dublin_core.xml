      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en_US">This poster reports on a study of a digital formative assessment tool designed to provide rich, formative information to both students and teachers during (and after) classroom instruction. Nine Algebra I teachers participated in a professional development series where they learned to use the tool in their classrooms. Results from student and teacher surveys suggest that the tool was effective for short-cycle formative assessments as well as facilitating mathematical classroom discourse. It also helped teachers display student work to build off their thinking and promote a growth mindset. This study has implications for the design technology and professional development that promote formative assessment, classroom discourse, and growth mindset thinking beyond a math classroom.</dcvalue>
