      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en_US">The goal of this study is to understand how grade 5 students as new knowledge builders adapt to the changes and address the challenges associated with Knowledge Building pedagogy to sustain their science inquiry over a school year. We observed the knowledge building process of a Grade 5 classroom that studied ecology, conducted in-depth semi-structured interview with nine students to gather detailed accounts of their personal experiences with science inquiry organized based on Knowledge Building pedagogy.  Qualitative analysis of the interviews in relation to the classroom observations elaborates how the students experienced changes in their learning and their socio-emotional and cognitive responses to these changes. The findings show that the students addressed the challenges brought by the changes by exerting a series of cognitive efforts themselves and by gaining support from their knowledge building community. </dcvalue>
