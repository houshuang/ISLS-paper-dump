      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en_US">Educational technology has been tremendously growing and there are many potentials for investigations. Phenomenography is known as a useful strategy to investigate variations in conceptual understandings of different phenomena. The paper aims to: (1) examine the research papers in educational technology studies over the past 15 years (2003-2017), and (2) evaluate the feasibility of phenomenography in the field of educational technology studies. A systematic review is done to the educational technology research papers that involve the use of phenomenography. A systematic literature search in the 14 SSCI journal websites produced 35 articles. Although there were only few papers which used phenomenography as research approach in educational technology studies, there was a gradual rise in the number of studies using phenomenography across years, with more focus on studying studentsâ€™ learning experiences, especially in the higher education sector. Implications about the use of phenomenography in educational technology field will be discussed.</dcvalue>
